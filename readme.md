# Mark as Done (Chrome & Firefox Extension)

> Mark any page as Done, Todo, or Started. All the links to that page will be automatically marked with an icon and colored, helping you keep track of your reading progress of large documentations or books.


For example, the following shows a partially read website, with some links marked as done.
